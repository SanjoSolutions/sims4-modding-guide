## Build pipeline

The file `tasks.json` contains tasks for building and deploying (to your Sims 4 mod folder) your mod. You can copy the file `tasks.json` to your project into the `.vscode` folder. The file `deploy.sh` is also required. Copy it into the root folder of your project and adjust the paths. You can find more information about Visual Studio Code tasks [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks).
